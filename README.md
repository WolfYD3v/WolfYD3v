Okay so ... I think I have to present myself. So ...
Hello besties cuties ! It's my WolfYD3v hi hi .
Hum yea , not so cliché maybe .

Hello I'm WolfYD3v or @WolfYD3v , it's up to you .
I am a young french independant game developer who is using the Godot Game Engine .
Unlike the vaste majority of people thinks , Python DON'T SUCK ! No Python don't suck .
But why do I use Godot ? I have x reasons :
- Godot itself : This engine can run on everything who is running Windows . It is only one executable file so I can put a copy on a USB Stick and use Godot while I am at school for example ;
- It's free : No paid versions , and no Unity fees like per install of your game ;
- Coding in Godot is easy : The GDScript is easy to learn and use , in an IDE inside of the Engine (So no need to open VSCode to code in Unity , this engine is not well made) .

As you can see I love Godot . I can say I am a part of the Godot cult , so it means I have a whole family and a source of importabt knowledge to know as a Godoter . 
If Musulmans has the Coran , Christians has the Bible , I also have a Bible ; The Godot Documentation .

What I am writing ... Using religion to ... 
... ... I don't see any problem with that . 

I am a guy with the greatest profil picture of the world . Yes .
I don't really know what to say actually ...
I think I can talk about my interests . I’m interested in a lot of things : Game developpement of course , 3D animation with Blender and doing little art projects (Strange or not) . 
I also like code , I’m currently learning Python in school , so it helps me in my Godot journey . The Object Oriented Programmation , the recursivity or the trees . A bunch of fun things . 

If you want to reach me (For any reason) :
- Discord : WolfY_D3v
I am present only on Discord for now , I  French or in English I am good with this language . 
I will launch a YouTube channel one day , so maybe I will be present on X , Facebook , Blusky , Google + , I don’t know actually , somewhere on the Internet . 

That's all now , for real .
