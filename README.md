Hi I'm WolfYD3v , or @WolfYD3v it's up to you .
I am the guy with the best profil picture of the universe !
Also I am French , so it means the metric system is better than others systems in the world .

I am a game developper who is using the Godot Engine , not Unity because you know the funny story about Unity .
I’m interested in a lot of things : Game developpement , 3D animation with Blender and doing art .
I’m currently learning Python in school and GDScript of course .

You can reach me on Discord under the username WolfY in French or in English I am good with this language , shocking right ?
That's all .

( There is irony on this , don't take it too seriously )
