Hello dear employe, or not employe, or before employe, or maybe new employe,

I am WolfY_D3v, CEO and the only communication guy of the WolfY_Corp (a great """official""" corporation YOU should join!)  
I also am a young and independant game developer at my Grand 18th years old.  
All my games and creations are avaible for free on my Itch.io, this is not the best things you will see but it's great. As I am happy with what I am doing my creations are great.  
My Itch.io page: https://wolfy400.itch.io/

I use my beloved game engine; The famous Godot Engine on my riced Linux Mint installation on my crappy laptop from the year before 2016. It doesn't support Vulkan that's so bad!  
*(laughting at my keyboard right now)*

But I also have a website I have made aaaaal by myself, and not with the help of Gemini aaaaat all.  
For the company's sake of course :)  
The corporation website: https://wolfyd3v.github.io/WolfY_CorpCompanyWebsite/

I have a Discord server, and a Revolt server, as two places where all my employes (servers members if you prefer) are and talk about neard stuff, where French is mostly the language used.  
- The Discord server: https://discord.gg/wqHbYyJttk
- The Revolt server: https://rvlt.gg/VkW7t5WW

And finally I have a Youtube channel.  
You can check it if you want (and if you understand French): https://youtube.com/@wolfy_d3v?si=VzD5bQHvzxCQMJPI

I’m interested in a lot of things:
- Game developpement (of course)
- 3D animation with Blender
- Doing little art projects (strange or not)
- Programming
